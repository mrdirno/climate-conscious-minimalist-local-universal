  "cover_prompt": "A solitary woman stands in quiet guardianship before the ancient, vaulted entrance of a stone granary built into a living cliffside, her hand resting on the weathered wood as if feeling its pulse, surrounded by shelves not of books but of meticulously labeled seed jars, dried herbs, and ecological records embedded in the very rock, the structure intertwined with roots and soft moss, embodying a library that is a living ecosystem. The scene is rendered in the atmospheric, textural, and spiritually resonant style of Agnes Lawrence Pelton and the precise, luminous environmental detail of Thomas Cole's early works, evoking a sacred, minimalist custodianship. The composition is a centered, book-cover framing with a slightly low-angle view, making the granary and its guardian monumental and imposing, yet intimate, with the vast, forgotten landscape of mist-shrouded valleys and resilient native flora unfolding behind her. The lighting is the soft, directional glow of dawn, with long, deep shadows and a color palette of earthy umbers, mineral greys, the faded gold of old paper, and the vital green of preserved life, all under a vast, universal sky. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
