## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter from the perspective of the forest or a specific element (the creek, an applewood log) observing the human drama.
- Create a 'found document'—a page from a settler's journal, a botanist's sketch, a child's drawing—that hints at the Granary's true nature.
- Draft a dialogue between two characters from Kells in the village pub, speculating about Elara and the stranger, revealing local lore and tension.
- Write a 'prequel' vignette showing a younger Elara learning one of the core principles of custodianship from her predecessor.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of the valley that reveals different layers (ecological, historical, mythical) as the user 'learns' more from the text.
- Design a 'Story Seed' system: a procedural generator that creates new 'Granary' locations and their unique rules/ecologies based on core narrative parameters.
